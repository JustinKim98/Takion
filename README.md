Takion is C++17 template based implementation of deep learning. It is suitable for deep learning on limited computational resource, embedded systems and IoT devices. The code can be compiled with commonly available compilers such as g++, clang++, or Microsoft Visual Studio. Takion currently supports macOS (10.12.6 or later), Ubuntu (18.04 or later), Windows (Visual Studio 2017 or later), and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Other untested platforms that support C++17 also should be able to build Takion.

## Key Features

- Reasonably fast, without GPU
- Portable & header-only
- Easy to integrate with real applications
- Simply implemented

## How to run unit tests

After browsing into cloned repository directory,

Change the value of trainFilePath and validationFilePath to the file path that you saved your 

mnist_train.csv and mnist_test.csv file

from 

Tests/UnitTests/GraphTest/SimpleGraphTest.cpp

line 308~310 (for linux and mac)

lime 301~306 (for windows)

Sample dataset can be downloaded from (https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv)

__Linux__
